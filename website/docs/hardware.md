Although the program works with most scales that support serial connections, we thought we'd highlight some models that work well for us.

We like the xxxxx as it's a more affordable option but still has all the essential features and most-importantly full support for the program including remote control via hot keys.
The xxxxx are a more expensive set of scales with a higher weight limit and more accurate measurements. It might be worth asking your school or local council to purchase these if you need to do very accurate measurements in practicals. These scales have equally good support for the program and support all the remote control features.
