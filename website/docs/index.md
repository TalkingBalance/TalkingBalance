Welcome to Talking Balance, a program you can use to make your scientific scales talk!
On this website you'll find download and set up instructions, as well as some FAQ's and our contact details if you'd like to get in touch.

## Getting started

To use this program, first ensure that you have access to a pair of scientific scales which are supported. These don't have to be special talking scales, they just need to support connecting to a computer via serial. You'll find a few recommended models on the recommended hardware page. You'll also need a couple of inexpensive adaptors to connect your computer to your scales, as most modern computers don't have a serial port.
Once you've got everything ready, just download our program, click it to run it, and get started. Hopefully, after that, you will have a talking balance!
